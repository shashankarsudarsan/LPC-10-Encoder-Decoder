# LPC-10-Encoder-Decoder
Implemented a LPC-10 Vocoder for a recorded speech signal

## Instructions
* Run the Encoder.m file first to save the matrices to be transmitted and ensure that Sample.wav audio file is in the same folder
* Now run the Decoder.m file to hear the reconstructed speech.
* All three speech files(Full Original, Encoded, Decoded) are in the folder.
* Transmitted.m contains the saved matrices and values which are typically transmitted in sequential manner in a real world scenario.
